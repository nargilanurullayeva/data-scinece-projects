# KNN and Naive Bayes Algorithms

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms for object detection. The project is structured as follows:

## Project Overview

- **Dataset Preparation:** The labeled dataset was imported into the coding environment.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Both KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms were implemented from scratch, without using any libraries.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.
- **Model Training:** The algorithms were trained using the training dataset.
- **Model Testing:** The trained models were tested using the test dataset, and labels were generated for the test dataset.
- **Accuracy Calculation:** The accuracy of the models was calculated by comparing the generated labels with the actual labels of the test dataset.

## Key Points

- **Algorithm Implementation:** Both KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms were implemented without using any libraries, focusing on understanding the underlying principles.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate the models' performance on unseen data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The accuracy of the models was calculated to assess their performance in object detection tasks.
- **Note:** This project was completed as part of a coursework, focusing on the practical implementation and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for object detection.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering:** Experiment with different features or feature combinations to improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the algorithms to achieve better results.
- **Model Selection:** Explore other machine learning algorithms to compare their performance with KNN and Naive Bayes.
