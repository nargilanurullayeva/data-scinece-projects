# KNN and Naive Bayes Algorithms

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms for object detection. The project is structured as follows:

## Project Overview

- **Dataset Preparation:** The labeled dataset was imported into the coding environment.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Both KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms were implemented from scratch, without using any libraries.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets.
- **Model Training:** The algorithms were trained using the training dataset.
- **Model Testing:** The trained models were tested using the test dataset, and labels were generated for the test dataset.
- **Accuracy Calculation:** The accuracy of the models was calculated by comparing the generated labels with the actual labels of the test dataset.

## Key Points

- **Algorithm Implementation:** Both KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms were implemented without using any libraries, focusing on understanding the underlying principles.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate the models' performance on unseen data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The accuracy of the models was calculated to assess their performance in object detection tasks.
- **Note:** This project was completed as part of a coursework, focusing on the practical implementation and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for object detection.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering:** Experiment with different features or feature combinations to improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the algorithms to achieve better results.
- **Model Selection:** Explore other machine learning algorithms to compare their performance with KNN and Naive Bayes.



# Penguin Species Classification and Clustering

## Classification
In this project, the goal is to create a classification model to determine the species of penguins based on the dataset's six features. The classification steps are as follows:
- Transfer the labeled dataset to the coding environment.
- Train the classification algorithms using the training data.
- Test the trained model using the test data and generate labels for the test data.
- Calculate the model's performance metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F Score, by comparing the generated labels with the actual labels of the test data.

## Clustering
In the clustering stage, the k-means algorithm will be applied to the dataset, using the same six features but ignoring the labels. The k value for the k-means algorithm will be set to 3 (total number of classes) since the data is labeled. After clustering, the results will be compared with the classification results and the actual data labels.

This project aims to improve understanding of classification and clustering algorithms and their applications in real-world datasets.
